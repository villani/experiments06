=============

Each ARFF base from Experiments04 are used for train and the nine remaining bases for test in the annotation medical images task. The performance from various classifiers are evaluated to this task. The classifiers used are MLkNN, BRkNN, ClassifierChain(kNN), HMC(kNN) and LabelPowerset(kNN). Furthermore, an evaluating is realized about what  extraction features techniques provides more relevant features to the classifiers from this task.
